      - title: Dynamical modeling and analysis to characterize seizure dynamics
        content: In a collaboration with Viktor Jirsa and Christophe Bernard (Marseille, France), we developed a dynamical model of seizure activity, based upon the bifurcations and state variables necessary to produce focal seizures. We found that the most common bifurcations were a saddle node at seizure onset, and a homoclinic bifurcation at offset. These bifurcations led to several predictions about canonical seizure dynamics, several of which we were able to validate in multiple species such as rats, mice, zebrafish, and humans. Using this framework, we are now categorizing human seizure dynamics on a larger scale, with the hopes of improving our understanding of the time course of seizures. We also use the model to assess perturbation responses and coupling dynamics, as well as to generate simulated seizures that are used to train classifiers for seizure detection and prediction.
