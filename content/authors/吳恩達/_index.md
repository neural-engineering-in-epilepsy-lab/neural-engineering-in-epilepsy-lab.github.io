# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I received both my medical degree and PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. I completed my Neurology residency at University Hospitals of Cleveland, followed by a clinical fellowship in Epilepsy at the University of Pennsylvania. While there, I also completed a post-doctorate in basic epilepsy research and earned a Master's in Translational Medicine. My clinical and research interests are deeply interconnected. I care for adult patients with epilepsy and lead an active research lab focused on understanding and controlling seizures using implantable devices. My lab combines electrophysiology, machine learning, signal processing, and computational modeling to advance this field. We work with data from a large, growing database of human patients as well as rodent models of epilepsy. Currently, our research explores the relationship between high-frequency oscillations and seizure mechanisms, and we are developing methods to target and stimulate the brain to stop seizures. In parallel, we are creating biophysical and dynamical models of epileptic activity to uncover the mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptic oscillations.

interests:
  - EEG
  - Epilepsy
  - intraoperative monitoring programs
  - Developing a research program focused on understanding mechanisms underlying the basic physiological generators of epileptic seizures and translating this work into novel device therapies to stop seizures
