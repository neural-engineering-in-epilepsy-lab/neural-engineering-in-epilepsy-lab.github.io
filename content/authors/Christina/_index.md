I am a student at the Univerity of Michigan studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. My research interests include natural language processing, human computer interaction, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in the neurotechnology domain. I am apart of the Neural Engineering in Epilepsy Lab, where I develop seizure detection and classification algorithms, as well as toolboxes for mathmatical simulations.
